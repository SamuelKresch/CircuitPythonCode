# Code for CircuitPython on WSS
## Finished (-ish)
- GPS (micropyGPS, ready for mpy-cross)

## In Progress
- Arducam (Capture function is finished, waiting for SD card breakout to test SD card function)

## In Stack
- LoRa radio (RFM95W over 915MHz, waiting on breakout board)
- IMU (Bosch BNO055 for now, but may switch to a different sensor since BNO055 may not be very accurate)
- Air sensor (primarily barometric for atmospheric test)
- Wi-Fi / Bluetooth (?), easier debugging out in field
